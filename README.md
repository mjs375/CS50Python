## GIT PULL: take changes on github.com, and pull them down to local version
git pull

## MERGE CONFLICT: multiple people have made changes...
  # "Conflict (content): merge conflict
  # Everything between <<< ... === you made
  # Everything between === ... >>> someone else made
  # Conflicting commit = "<some number: 5756c5434d89f..."
## How to address the merge conflict: which version do you want to keep? or combine them in some way?
  # Make your changes, then commit them...
